# Component Library

This directory contains all reusable components organized by purpose and domain.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, cards, forms)
- `features/` - Business domain components (auth, membership, admin, etc.)
- `navigation/` - Navigation and language components  
- `layout/` - Layout-specific components

## Guidelines

- Components should be self-contained and reusable
- Follow the established naming conventions
- Place domain-specific logic in appropriate feature directories
- Keep UI components generic and configurable
