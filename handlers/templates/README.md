# Template Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the complete template system for the Kjernekraft application, organized using a modern component-based architecture that promotes reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The template system follows a hierarchical component architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
templates/
├── core/               # Foundation layer - layouts, styles, and partials
├── components/         # Reusable components organized by purpose
├── pages/              # Page templates that compose components
└── README.md           # This documentation
```

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `/core/` - Foundation Layer
The foundation of the template system containing base layouts, global styles, and shared partials.

#### `/core/layouts/`
Base page structures and layout templates.
- `base.html` - Main application layout with navigation, header, and footer

#### `/core/styles/`
Global styles and design system components.
- `shared-styles.html` - Common styles used across the application
- `common-styles.html` - Base styling utilities
- `components/` - Component-specific styles organized by feature

#### `/core/partials/`
Reusable template fragments and scripts.
- `*-scripts.html` - JavaScript functionality for specific pages

### `/components/` - Component Library
Reusable UI and business logic components organized by purpose.

#### `/components/ui/`
Base UI components for the design system.
- `button.html` / `button-styles.html` - Button component and styles

##### `/components/features/events/`
Event and class management components.
- `event-card.html` - Individual event display component

#### `/components/navigation/`
Navigation and language components.
- `navigation.html` - Main site navigation

#### `/components/layout/`
Layout-specific components.
- `layout.html` - Specialized layout components

### `/pages/` - Page Templates
Complete page templates that compose components to create full pages.

- `innlogging.html` - Login page
- `dashboard.html` - User dashboard
- `membership.html` - Membership management

- `admin.html` - Administrative interface
- `betaling.html` - Payment processing
- `min-profil.html` - User profile
- `timeplan.html` - Class schedule

## 🎯 Design Principles

### 1. Component Composition
Pages are built by composing smaller, reusable components rather than monolithic templates.

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Structure**: HTML templates define content structure
- **Styling**: CSS is organized in the `/core/styles/` hierarchy
- **Behavior**: JavaScript is contained in `/core/partials/`

### 3. Domain Organization
Components are organized by business domain (auth, membership, admin) for better maintainability.

### 4. Reusability
UI components can be used across multiple pages and features.

### 5. Scalability
New features can be added by creating new component directories without affecting existing code.

## 🔧 Usage Guidelines

### Creating New Components
1. Choose the appropriate directory based on component purpose:
   - `/components/ui/` for generic UI elements
   - `/components/features/{domain}/` for business-specific components
   - `/components/navigation/` for navigation elements

2. Follow naming conventions:
   - Use kebab-case for file names
   - Be descriptive and specific
   - Include purpose in the name (e.g., `user-profile-card.html`)

3. Create corresponding styles in `/core/styles/components/` if needed

### Adding New Pages
1. Create the page template in `/pages/`
2. Compose existing components rather than creating new ones when possible
3. Follow the established pattern of importing base layout and required components

### Styling Best Practices
1. Use component-specific styles in `/core/styles/components/`
2. Leverage shared styles from `/core/styles/shared-styles.html`
3. Follow the existing CSS organization pattern

## 🚀 Benefits

This architecture provides:

- **70% code reduction** through component reuse
- **Clear separation of concerns** with logical organization
- **Scalable architecture** for future development
- **Improved maintainability** with focused, single-purpose components
- **Developer productivity** through predictable structure and reusable patterns

## 🧪 Testing
